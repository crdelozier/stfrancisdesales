Introduction
============

In this lesson, we briefly introduce the topic of computer science and ask the students about their knowledge of computers.
We then split the students into groups for an exercise in "Programming the Instructor" in various tasks.

Introductory Questions
======================

* What skills can students expect to learn from this class?
  * Build a website
  * Write computer programs like simple video games
* How often do students use a computer?
  * Be sure to indicate to them that their phones are small computers and mention that computers used to be the size of the room they're sitting in
* What do they use computers for?

Example
========

* Have a student come up to the front of the class
  * Have them take a deck of cards out of the box
  * Have them hold the cards so that they're upside down
  * Have them place a card in the center of the deck
  * Repeat a few times
  * Tell them to repeat 100 times (and then obviously tell them you're kidding if they start to do it)

Programming Exercise
====================

* Divide students into groups and assign a problem to each group
* Make sure they know that they'll have a few minutes to solve the problem and then a chance to revise their solution after an initial try

* Problems
  * Draw a square on the whiteboard/chalkboard
  
* Provide a simple vocabulary of what the instructor (the computer) will understand
  * e.g. vertical, horizontal, parallel, identical
* Give 5-10 minutes for students to write down a step-by-step algorithm for how to solve the problem
* Once they're done, collect solutions and demo them as if you're a computer
* Time permitting, give students another 5-10 minutes and the same (or another) problem to solve

Follow-up Discussion
====================

* Talk to the students about what went right with their solutions and what went wrong
* Discuss that computers are very "literal", that they'll do exactly what you tell them to
* Introduce the term "algorithm"
  * Ask how many students are involved in music of some sort and ask about the term "rhythm"
  * If asked, the word algorithm doesn't come from rhythm, but comes from the name Al-Khwarizmi, a mathematician born in 780
* Ask students what would have made "programming the instructor" easier for them
  * Try to foreshadow concepts like functions, abstractions, libraries, etc.
