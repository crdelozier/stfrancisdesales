Looking at some code!
=====================

In this lesson, we want to give some context for how the problems that the students worked on in their last class relate to the problems that they can solve with a computer.
We'll introduce the Processing language and demo some code that draws shapes on a blank background.

Initial Discussion
==================

* What did we do in the last class?
* What were some of the challenges involved in designing an algorithm?

Installing and Starting Processing
==================================

* TODO: Notes on how to get Processing installed and running on student computers

Demo
====

* Demonstrate a simple program that draws a square that follows the mouse
* Show the code for the program and briefly cover what it does
  * Try to not go too far into specifics about how the code works.  This example is just to show what some code looks like.

Follow-Up Discussion
====================

* Discuss how solving the problem in code is similar to writing the real-life algorithms that they worked on in the previous class
  * Reiterate the terms "algorithm" and "abstraction"
