# Lesson Notes for Coding Instruction at St. Francis de Sales

This repository holds my lesson notes used in teaching 6th through 8th grade coding at St. Francis de Sales school.  For 5th grade students, I loosely followed the Scratch Creative Computing curriculum.

I originally organized this into numbered lessons, but as I went on with the course, it seemed better to organize it into concepts so that I could move through the material more slowly if necessary.

I would suggest working through these notes in the following order:

* Introduction
* Colors
* Shapes
* Collisions
* Pong
* Loops
* Arrays
* Simon
* Reading an API
